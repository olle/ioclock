A dynamic ``datetime`` field handler widget, that provides a user-friendly
date and time input process.

## Getting started

For your convenience there's a ``Makefile`` that will check and set up your
environment (NodeJS, Bower, Grunt and tasks). Simply run make to get going:

    make
    
TODO: More coming soon...

Happy hacking!
